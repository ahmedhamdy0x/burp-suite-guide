## Core Features

### Proxy

The Proxy feature in Burp Suite is essential for intercepting and analyzing HTTP and HTTPS traffic between your browser or application and the web server. It acts as a proxy server, sitting between your client (browser) and the server, allowing you to monitor, intercept, and modify requests and responses in real-time.

#### Usage:

1. **Intercepting Traffic:**
   - Start by configuring your browser to use Burp Suite as a proxy (as discussed in the Getting Started section).
   - Burp Suite intercepts all requests and responses between your browser and the server.
   - You can view intercepted requests and responses in the Proxy tab of Burp Suite.

2. **Request Manipulation:**
   - Intercepted requests can be modified before they are sent to the server.
   - This allows you to tamper with parameters, headers, cookies, and other parts of the request.
   - Right-click on a request in the Intercept tab to send it to other tools (like Repeater or Intruder) for further analysis or manipulation.

3. **Response Analysis:**
   - Intercepted responses can be analyzed for vulnerabilities, sensitive information disclosure, or other security issues.
   - Burp Suite provides detailed views of response headers, body content, and cookies.

4. **Session Handling:**
   - Manage session cookies and authentication tokens during testing.
   - You can edit, delete, or add cookies to simulate different user sessions or bypass authentication mechanisms.

5. **SSL/TLS Decryption:**
   - Burp Suite can decrypt SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic if you have installed its CA certificate in your browser.
   - This allows you to inspect HTTPS traffic, view encrypted data, and analyze secure communications for vulnerabilities.

6. **Automatic Scanner Integration:**
   - Integrate Burp Suite's automated vulnerability scanner to scan intercepted requests for common security issues.
   - The Scanner tab in Burp Suite provides results and alerts for identified vulnerabilities.

### Spider

The Spider feature in Burp Suite is designed to automate the process of navigating through a web application, discovering and mapping its content and functionality. It simulates a human user browsing through links, forms, and other accessible resources within the application, effectively creating a structural map (sitemap) of the target application.

#### Usage:

1. **Mapping Application Structure:**
   - **Starting Point:** Begin by configuring the Spider to start from a specific URL or a set of URLs within the application.
   - **Crawling Process:** The Spider will follow links and submit forms discovered on each page it visits.
   - **Depth and Scope:** Define the depth and scope of the crawl to control how far and wide the Spider explores the application.

2. **Discovering Endpoints and Resources:**
   - As the Spider navigates through the application, it identifies and lists endpoints, directories, scripts, parameters, and other resources.
   - This helps in identifying hidden or less accessible parts of the application that may not be directly linked from the main pages.

3. **Mapping Links and Relationships:**
   - The Spider maps relationships between different pages and resources within the application.
   - It provides a visual representation of how pages are interconnected, which is useful for understanding the application's navigation flow and potential attack surfaces.

4. **Reporting and Analysis:**
   - Burp Suite generates reports and visual maps based on the Spider's crawl results.
   - Reports may include lists of discovered URLs, directories, parameters, and potential vulnerabilities associated with the discovered content.

5. **Customization and Configuration:**
   - Customize Spider settings to exclude certain URL patterns, restrict crawling to specific domains or subdomains, and adjust the number of simultaneous requests.
   - Configure authentication credentials if the application requires login to access certain areas.

6. **Integration with Other Tools:**
   - Use Spider results as input for other Burp Suite tools like Scanner, Intruder, or Repeater.
   - This integration allows for targeted testing of specific endpoints or areas identified during the crawling process.
